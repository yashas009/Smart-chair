# Smart-chair
Designing a smart chair that will continuously detect the users sitting posture and sends an alarm for wrong postures.

Many of us are spending lot of hours sitting next to a screen with many health issues emerging due to wrong sitting postures. The aim of this project is to minimize the health problems by alarming the person to fix his posture. The project is based on an ultrasonic sensor fixed at the back of the chair. The sensor will continuously measure the distance to the back of the sitting person. Any increase in the distance indicates bending of the back. This will trigger an alarm beeping sound. All the process is coordinated through an arduino board.

Parts required:

Arduino UNO x 1

Buzzer x 1

Ultrasonic Sensor - HC-SR04 x 1

Jumper wires

9 Volt Battery x 1
